-	To see what you can do, first type “hello” or “hey.”
-	The chatbot should then guide you from there

## Idea
Applying to colleges can be a tough task. Choosing which college to attend is even more difficult. The decision one makes about college can affect their career forever. With the millions of factors that play an important role in the college decision process, it is hard to keep track of which option would be the idlest. With my chatbot, I aim to help many students going through this process. Using my chatbot, they can get a direct correlation and comparison between colleges so they are not only aware of the facts about those colleges but can also see the comparison in one place. Depending on the factors that matter most to them, they can ask about that factor, for example, cost of attendance, graduation rate, acceptance rate, sex ratio and student to faculty ratio. 

## Tech Stack/ Resources
❖	Dialogflow environment: this was the environment I used to create my chatbot on. It is a simple, elegant and user-friendly platform created by Google. It provided me with a way to understand Natural Language Processing without having to mess with too much coding.

❖	Javascript: For the purpose of the fulfillment and integration purposes of the chatbot, I used Javascript.  

❖	Mackinvia and Core: For the purposes of my research, I used Mackinvia and Core to search up some good research papers on the topic of NLP, AI, Machine Learning and chatbots. They provided me with some good peer-reviewed, reliable resources.

❖	Udemy and Youtube:I watched many videos to familiarize myself with Dialogflow platform and Javascript. 


## Results
Through my hard work and perseveration, I was able to complete a fully functional chatbot which can compare five different factors among the top three public Universities of Texas: UT Dallas, UT Austin, and Texas A&M. I also created my own Google Assistant with the help of the AIY voice kit. Now, I wish to integrate the two so that my chatbot is functional using voice command as well. I have also been successful in integrating my chatbot via voice command on Google Assistant.
